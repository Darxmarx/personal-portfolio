# Personal Portfolio

## Description

A simple, yet sophisticated portfolio containing some samples of my coding work and ways to contact me.

## Installation

Link to the site: https://darxmarx.github.io/personal-portfolio/

## Usage 

This website is well-organized gathering hub for some of my coding work, even if some links are duplicated placeholders for the time being. As I continue to place my efforts in full-stack web development, I can quickly update this site with my personal best coding works. Each image of my work actually links to its respective deployed site, ensuring quick access to an easy glance at my ability. The UI is intuitively organized by demonstrating my hardest work as the largest, most obvious image to click, and everything else is listed afterwards. In addition, the website includes easy links to my Linkedin, my GitHub profile, and direct access to contacting my email account.
